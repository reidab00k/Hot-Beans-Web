        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is Reid, and I am an aspiring web developer with a strong passion for creating clean, modern, and user-friendly websites.

            I have always been interested in how websites are built and how design and technology come together to create something that people interact with every day.

            Over time, I have developed skills in HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript, and I enjoy experimenting with layouts, styles, and responsive features to make websites that look good on all devices.

            I created Hot Beans Web as a way to develop my skills further and to showcase my ability to design simple, effective web pages that are both visually appealing and easy to navigate.

            I take pride in writing organised code, paying attention to detail, and continuously improving my understanding of web technologies.

            My goal as a developer is to keep learning, build more advanced projects, and eventually work with clients or companies to bring their digital ideas to life.

            I am motivated, reliable, and always excited to learn new tools, techniques, and best practices in the web development world.

            Through this project, I hope to demonstrate not only my technical abilities but also my creativity and enthusiasm for building professional-quality websites.

            We design clean, modern, and user-friendly websites that focus on layout, accessibility, and ease of navigation.

            Our designs are tailored to ensure that visitors can find the information they need quickly and enjoy a positive browsing experience.

            By using consistent styles, colour themes, and clear content structure, we create websites that look professional and function smoothly.

        <p>
            Using HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript, we build the visual and interactive parts of your website.

            This includes everything from structuring your pages and formatting your content to adding interactive elements that improve the user experience.

            We write organised, easy-to-maintain code that makes your website reliable and simple to edit in the future.

        <ol class="ol">Responsive Mobile Layouts</ol>

        <p>
            Every website we create is designed to work on all devices, including phones, tablets, and desktops.

            We use responsive design techniques to ensure your pages automatically adjust to different screen sizes, making your website accessible and user-friendly for everyone.
        </p>

        <ol class="ol">Website Maintenance</ol>

        <p>
            In addition to building websites, we also offer basic maintenance services.

            This includes updating content, adjusting layouts, fixing bugs, and keeping the website running smoothly over time.

            This service is especially helpful for clients who want their site to stay fresh without needing to manage the technical side themselves.
        </p>
